## About Genipak and Magicard
Genipak and Magicard are Sega Genesis/MegaDrive cheating devices similar to Game Genie. Genipak was developed by Realtek in 1992, and Magicard is a modified version released by Gametec. They are technically ROM bus patching tools.

The code formats of Genipak and Magicard are different. But the internal algorithm is the same.

## How to use
For the Node.js version, you need to install Node.js first. Then run `node genipakEncDec.js` or `node magicardEncDec.js` to check the detailed usage notes.

For the HTML version, just open the index.html file in your browser. Enter the code and press the corresponding button to convert.
